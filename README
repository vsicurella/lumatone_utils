Utilities for dealing with Lumatone files
-----------------------------------------

These are work in progress, and have some --help documentation.

Example: making a magic mapping for 19 steps to an octave
covering what would be a perfect fourth in a Bosanquet mapping:

Take the color scheme from an existing mapping file and make
a new magic mapping using it with 19 steps to an octave
covering what would be a perfect fourth in a Bosanquet mapping:

./extract_scheme.py -t 60 -p 19 mappings/tricolour_c.ltn |
    ./apply_scheme.py -t 60 --input ./tricolour.scheme --gap 19 <(
    ./make_regular.py -t 6 -l 1 -g 19 --channels 1 1 1 5 5
    ) -o mappings/tricolour_g.ltn
